## Notes
Security Issues to consider in other languages:

Possible exploits in other languages:
--open comments are allowed in other languages--can that lead to possible exploits
--array of non fixed sizes and types are also common in other languages and can be an exploit
--other lower level languages allow arrays to be accessed beyond their lenght and will return whatever is at the location
